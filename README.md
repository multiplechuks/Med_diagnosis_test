# Medical Diagnosis System Coding Test

## Task Description

There is a publicly available API for medical diagnosis or symptomps checker [apimedic.com](https://apimedic.com/). Using this API as a symptomp checker, develop an application (Web or Console) that allows users to

- Collect patient vital signs and symptoms.
- Provide initial diagnoses based on the collected symptom data.
- Schedule appointments with specialized doctors based on diagnosis results.

## Requirements

- Implement the application using MVC architecture.
- Use VB.NET or .NET Core or Java.
- Integrate with the medical diagnosis API from [apimedic.com](https://apimedic.com/).

## Input Assumptions
- Assume that the API is always avaialble and up to date.

## Code Ownership: 
Your solution should include source code primarily written by you. You can use external libraries but ensure the core of the solution is your original work.

## Submission

While a production-ready application is not required, we encourage you to submit your best effort. We understand your time constraints and commitments
You can submit your coding solution in one of two ways.
1. By emailing a compressed (zip) `Medical_YourName.zip` file with all of your files to the recruiter that sent you the coding test. Note that .RAR or class files will not be accepted or executed due to security.
2. By sending a git repo of the project to the email


## Implementing and Packaging Your Solution:

Implement your solution with any of VB.NET, C# or Java. Please write automated tests and include them with your submission.

Your solution will be assessed on correctness.

In addition to your code and tests, please also include a README that explains:

- An overview of your design decisions
- How to run your code and tests, including how to compile it if applicable and how to install any dependencies your code may have.

Good Luck!
